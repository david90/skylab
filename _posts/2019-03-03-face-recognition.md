## Lock security, or unlock business opportunities with face

Face recognition technology is a machine learning algorithm which is built to identify and verify a person from a digital image or video frame (also described as biometric artificial intelligence). It identifies a person with detection of distinctive facial features. The contactless process of identity recognition made security checks never been smoother, while its non-invasive nature enables more business opportunities for targeted marketing.
