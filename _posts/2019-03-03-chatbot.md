## Solve customer's enquiry even at midnight with chatbot, in human tone

Chatbot has been widely adopted in all kinds of industries nowadays. You may have experienced how chatbot provides instant customer service already. Conversational commerce is the new standard for customer satisfaction. Customers not only expect answers, but also how you provide the answers. Different from the common chatbots which follows pre-set scripts, we design *sequence-to-sequence* chatbot which enable real conversational experience to the customers. By gathering massive training data, our sequence-to-sequence model can understand the keywords in a sentence, and predict replies best fit to the question. Customize chatbots to fit your business, you will see how it can improve the customer journey with technology.


### Use case

#### 9up bot
The idea of 9up bot comes from a funny side project. Cantonese is one of the most difficult language in the world. We want to take the challenge and check if a well-trained chatbot could handle a complicated language. We feed the data from a popular discussion forum in Hong Kong to train a sequence-to-sequence model. The trained model would be able to reply messages in Cantonese by analyzing keywords in a sentence and generate similar replies from the database.
