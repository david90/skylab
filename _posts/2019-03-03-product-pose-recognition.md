## A robust, fast way to recognize postures

Although pose recognition is less well known than face recognition, it is gradually becoming popular, usually being adopted in robots. Its ability of detecting human body and hand keypoints on single images has extended the business opportunities from using face to using pose as subject.


### Use Case

The baduanjin qigong (八段錦) is one of the most common forms of Chinese qigong. Lots of people practice baduanjin as exercises, but most of them do not have a coach and they are not sure if the postures are correct. We built a pose recognition model to recognize postures in a video frame. The model is able to tell if the person in the framed video has played baduanjin in accurate.
