## Let OCR reads data for you

Data is an important asset to enterprises. However, data processing can be an extremely time-consuming task for many companies, like extracting data from a receipt to prepare financial report, or from an application form to build a customer database. The traditional way of data processing is asking a clerk to identify the data manually then input into the system. 1,000 forms, just repeat 1,000 times. 


From now on you can free the staff from spending countless hours on manual classifying and typing. With our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, you can now convert data from different kinds of forms and receipts into digital text with just one click. Different from the common existing OCR tools, we offer a OCR API that can integrate with mobile application and *convert image into structured data in JSON format*. You do not need to spend time on restructuring from a pool of unorganized data. All you need to do is providing a standard form, our OCR form capturer will mark the position and return captured data in format. You can even call data from specific fields only, saving time from doing a search in the whole database.
